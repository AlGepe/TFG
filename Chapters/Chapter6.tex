\chapter{Simulation vs Reality: are TRACS results real?}

Let's take a look at the future posibilities and possible improvements of the software.

\section{Experimental procedure} % (fold)
\label{sec:future_improvements}

Make trapping random and/or position dependent. Implement diffusion. Parallelization. Multiplication layers (LGAD). 3D detectors...

It has already been used for simulations of the still-in-development TPA characterization. It's used regularly in IFCA by Ivan's group. Coupled with the laser simulator it can help understad detectors and how radiation damages them.
